# ApexaIQ Research & Documentation
## By Pranit Dalvi

## 1. What does ApexaIQ  do & what industry problem does it solve?
ApexaIQ  is **the asset inventory management platform** that delivers clean, trusted data, uncovers shadow IT, and empowers you to find, fix, and report—before risk becomes reality.

**Problem solved:** Organizations face fragmented and incomplete asset data spread across EDR, MDM, cloud consoles, and spreadsheets. This fragmentation prevents accurate vulnerability management, compliance reporting, and Zero Trust implementation. ApexaIQ  unifies discovery, computes a single score, and guides remediation, reducing cyber risk.

## 2. IT Asset Management (ITAM) & why companies need ITAM software
**ITAM Definition:**  it's the practice of tracking and managing an organization’s IT assets throughout their entire lifecycle, from procurement to disposal.

**Why ITAM software is essential:**
- **Accurate inventory** — prerequisite for vulnerability and patch management.
- **Cost optimization** — avoids unused licenses and wasted resources.
- **Risk reduction** — prevents rogue/obsolete assets from being exploited.
- **Audit & due diligence** — ensures quick, reliable discovery in M&A or security assessments.

### B. Qualys (VMDR / CSAM)
- **Focus:** Vulnerability-first platform with integrated scanning and remediation.
- **Differentiator:** Deep vulnerability scanning and patch guidance.
- **Vs ApexaIQ :** Qualys is vulnerability-centric; ApexaIQ  is hygiene and asset assurance focused.

### C. runZero
- **Focus:** Network-centric discovery, exposure management for OT/IoT.
- **Differentiator:** Strength in discovering unmanaged and fragile devices.
- **Vs ApexaIQ :** runZero emphasizes discovery; ApexaIQ  emphasizes hygiene scoring and compliance workflows.

## 4. Why is ApexaIQ  an agentless platform?
- **Agentless approach** An agentless approach refers to a method of collecting data, monitoring systems, or managing assets without installing software agents on the target devices. Instead of deploying a small program (agent) on each machine, the system uses existing protocols, APIs, or remote access methods to gather information.

- **Advantages:**
  - Faster access to the information regarding the asset.
  - Cost effective.
  - Does not require the pre installation of software agents on each device.

  Hence, due to these reasons ApexIQ is Agentless.

## 5. Documentation and research on Cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It involves using technologies, processes, and policies to defend against threats like:
  - Malware (viruses, ransomware, spyware)
  - Phishing (fake emails or websites that trick users into revealing sensitive info)
  - Data breaches (unauthorized access to personal or corporate data)
  - DDoS attacks (flooding servers to crash websites or services)

  It’s also known as Information Security (INFOSEC) or System Security.

  Importance of cybersecurity:
  - It protects systems and data from cyber attackers.
  - Data loss and data damage is reduced.
  - Helps organizations meet legal and regulatory standards

## 6. Study Guide: Key Concepts

- **ApexaIQ  Score:** - Proprietary risk and hygiene score provided by ApexaIQ.
- **IT Asset Management:** it's the practice of tracking and managing an organization’s IT assets throughout their entire lifecycle, from procurement to disposal.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or network that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or steal data.
- **Obsolescence:** Outdated/unsupported assets.
- **Compliance:** Compliance means following rules, laws, standards, or policies that apply to your organization, industry, or system.
- **Maintenance:** Ongoing updates and servicing of assets.
- **EOL/EOS/EOM:**
  - End of life(EOL)-The product is no longer sold or supported by the vendor.
  - End of Service(EOS)-The vendor stops providing updates, patches, or technical assistance.
  - End of Maintenance(EOM)-No more bug fixes, security patches, or performance improvements.
- **Asset Hygiene:** Degree to which assets are patched, supported, and compliant.
- **Crown Jewels:** Most critical business assets. These are to be managed in a proper way.
- **Inventory:** Central list of all IT assets.
- **NVD:** NVD (National Vulnerability Database): Managed by NIST, it provides standardized information about known vulnerabilities and assigns CVE IDs.
- **Patch Management:** Updates to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Data Breaches:** Security incidents where sensitive data is exposed.
- **MSP:** Managed Service Provider.
- **Device Types:** Endpoints, servers, IoT, OT, VMs, containers.
- **True SaaS:** Multi-tenant, cloud-delivered service. It's about how the software is built, driven and maintained. 
- **Inbound/Outbound Integration:** Data ingestion vs. action pushing.
- **Compliance Standards:** ISO 27001, HIPAA. These are widely recognized standards and regulations:
    - ISO 27001
        - Global standard for managing information security.
        - Focuses on risk assessment, security policies, and continuous improvement.
    - HIPAA
      - U.S. law protecting healthcare data (PHI/ePHI).
      - Requires encryption, access control, and breach notifications.
- **Perimeter:** Traditional boundary; largely replaced by Zero Trust.
- **ROI/KPI:** 
    - ROI: ROI is a financial metric that measures how much profit or benefit you gain from an investment compared to its cost.
    - KPI (Key Performance Indicator): KPIs are measurable values that show how effectively an individual, team, or organization is achieving objectives. They can be financial (like ROI) or non-financial (like customer satisfaction).
- **Auto-remediation:** Automated fixes triggered by security tools.
- **Network Protocols:** SNMP, WMI, SSH, ARP, ICMP, etc. used in discovery.
- **Due Diligence:** Due diligence is the systematic process of investigating, verifying, and evaluating a company, individual, or asset before making a decision—commonly during Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A), investments, partnerships, or audits.
- **SOAR:** Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. SOAR is a category of security solutions that help organizations manage, automate, and respond to security threats by connecting multiple tools and processes into a unified system.
- **Zero Trust & ITAM:** ITAM provides visibility essential for Zero Trust.
- **CAASM:** CAASM stands for Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management — a modern cybersecurity approach that gives organizations full visibility into their digital assets and the risks they pose. It’s especially relevant for complex IT environments like hybrid cloud setups, remote workforces, and shadow IT.
